# End Of Year Reviews

## FY22

### Looking back:

1. **How do you think the last 6 months has gone for you?**

- On an ASOS scale, I think I've "nailed it".
- With the extended (and mixed) remit for line managing nearly 20 engineers across 3 platforms for half of it (and eventually reducing to 2 platforms when Jen joined), everyone has been developing themselves and delivering as expected without any significant concerns.
- I typically set myself too much to do within my capacity, sometime focused on org-wide initiatives over individuals or teams, which is not ideal considering the EM pyramid
- I could've got into the detail more with team optimisations but relied on influencing/mentoring individuals to make improvements
- Treading water feels like an appropriate analogy

2. **Out of everything you’ve done and achieved this last 6 months, what’s the one thing that stands out that you’re proud of?**

- Releasing the ASOS Tech Podcast in the Summer and announcing to the entire Engineering Update audience

3. **Was there anything you found particularly challenging?**

- Managing all the bottlenecks to get the podcast live, personally and by facilitation
- Recruiting SSE's - virtually impossible by ASOS standards with limited reward packages
- Challenging the PX processes that typically slow down any significant change for individuals, as often discussed with the other 20+ EM's

4. **What would you do differently?**



### Looking inwards:

1. What are some key things you learned?
2. What are some key areas of development?

### Looking ahead:

1. Based on the last 6 months, and peer feedback, what do you want to achieve or focus on, what’re you looking forward to over the next 6 months
2. Is there anything you’re not looking forward to?
3. When do you see yourself reaching the next level?

## Workday Feedback Questions 

There will be a Workday self evaluation feedback form - please fill out when it arrives as we’ve dropped these Qs from our form.

### Objectives
_Provide a year end summary of your performance against your objectives that you and your manager agreed earlier in the year. Specifically, provide detail about "what" results were achieved:_

**A: Engineer Growth**

1. Realistic structured objectives using standard OKR format - disappointed this didn't work out, mixed reasons, failed to influence change and hold individuals accountable to their own objectives
2. Engineer's personal stretch goals (career, skills, passions) defined with actionable objective to support - some engineers identified stretch goals (such as public speaking with Sertan and Devesh, Georgia working in different team, Harry mentoring, Sarah recording a podcast)
3. Setup "brag/hype" docs for regular feedback (speedback) directly between engineers to support & adjust objectives - a handful of engineers (Spartans, Harry, Nick, Ryan) have started contributing reglarly to this after demonstrating my own
4. Enable more FORDS engineers to demonstrate skills and passions to internal ASOS audiences through Lightning Talks, FORDS Eng Monthly and Tech Develops - most Lightning Talks are hosted by FORDS engineers, Eng Monthly has been described by Lewis J as "best meeting of the month" due to range of speakers, Sertan & Seb running Tech Dev on IOT devices

**B: Vibe**

5. Improve response rate for next Vibe feedback from 75% - we did with 85%. Results from latest round suggested most areas were already covered in wider pieces but those within remit haven't gained traction.

**C: Team Health**

6. Introduce PETALS framework to all FORDS teams in OM, D&R, S&F - Artemis adopted and made it weekly, Ares & Apollo tried once, Kallo tried a couple times then adopted their own
7. Establish regular cadence recording and observing results for all FORDS teams - only Kallo and Artemis have adopted a form of it

**D: Tech Brand**

8. Consistently regular cadence of Tech Blog content from diverse ASOS tech talent in a streamlined process - established a close community of blog editors to encourage and release regular content, now on a (twice) monthly cadence and pipeline to expedite urgent content (NI recruitment piece)
9. Regular Tech Podcast content released from diverse ASOS talent with variety of internal hosts and guests - released in July after months of planning, producing and approving, fortnightly cadence established (albeit August hurdle of music licence), with plan for Season 2 in 2023

**E: Recruitment**

10. Execution of FTE hiring plan - filled all prioritised open headcount by EOY with external candidates and internal promotions

**F: Personal Growth**

11. Understand and practice some coaching principles - explored training programmes but lacked capacity or shared commitment. Joined EM Coaching group with only 1 successful session with Jon Taylor
12. Identify and agree coaching opportunities within direct reports or peers - nope
Start the coaching apprenticeship - non-starter

### Day Job
_Also reflect on your overall performance in terms of what you have achieved in your role day to day. Make note of what you have delivered in addition to your objectives:_

Objectives aside and going through all the EM Competency matrix, I think I'm doing the a good job as an EM. I focus on the my individual direct reports as a priority, attempt to be available and support the the teams, plus work across Tech with other EM's and PSE's to drive improvements.

I'm mindful of priorities and adjust accordingly, sometimes at the detriment of my own development and capacity. 

All the engineers I manage have seen personal improvements with significant promotions recognised where possible (either at mid-points or in-role).

Teams are mostly mature in delivery and operations with little resistance and minimal support from myself.

I've found suitable relationships and dynamics with all my peers (PLs and LSEs) to support our teams. 


### Being ASOS
_After describing "what" results were achieved, explain "how" those results were achieved. Reflect on our [Being ASOS](https://asos.looop.co/workspace/8538) behaviours and [ASOS ABCD values](https://asos.looop.co/topic/70314) and consider how you have demonstrated these results:_

Much of the feedback from peers and direct reports suggest I'm demonstrating all our ASOS values and behaviours on a daily basis.

I think the podcast is a great example of the ABCDs - genuinely pushing everything about myself and people around me, putting myself and others in challenging situations (publicly and internally), working creatively to make it sound and look the best and delivering within timelines against so many challenges.

All my direct reports suggest I am genuinely empathetic and approachable, leading by example, bringing people with me on the journey.

The fact PX have asked me to be one of the faces for our Tech Value Proposition says a lot; as a leader in our tech community, boomerang and development journey over the past 9 years. 

### Individual development
_Earlier in the year we also asked you to think about your individual development. Describe what you have done to work towards or achieve your individual development goal(s):_

This is what I've neglected and should possibly look for extra capacity in the next mid-year. Coaching has been a slow/non-starter but I need to build on confidence to push back, say no/not yet more and challenge status quo in larger remits (e.g. PX/Tech processes)
